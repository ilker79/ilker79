Hello, I am Ilker.

I worked as a Metallurgist for almost a decade but software development and coding have been always a passion of mine. Therefore, I applied for a intensive 13 weeks bootcamp provided by School of Code and I was selected along with 29 other bootcampers from over 1000+ applications and completed the bootcamp in April 2021.

One of the main reason why I want to change my career is that I enjoy coding. My journey started with Java. I first started learnig basics of Java as a hobby, it was fun to write very simple apps on a Notepad and complie them on Command-line to see what they do, find the bugs and fix them. Then, I realized that I would love to work in this field as I enjoy solving problems with code very much. When I did some research I found out that many people changed their career and started working in the tech industry. I spoke to those people and they encouraged me to do so.  

Please take a look at my repo's and let me know what you think. I will be contuniously working on my personal projects to learn and develop myself.
